## Edit config.js

You will need to create your config file using the template provided:

$ cp config.sample.js config.js
```

Look for the following section, and enter in your RingCentral Client ID, and set the server to the proper environment:

```json
//// ringcentral config
ringCentralConfigs: {
  // your ringCentral app's Client ID
  // clientID: 'qypCMJuSOOseWivhrrGVeCrw',

  // your ringCentral app's Auth Server URL
  // appServer: 'https://platform.devtest.ringcentral.com'
},
```

Finally, fill out the configuration information for your HubSpot application. Look for the following section and fill out accordingly (you should only need to provide your Client ID and Secret):

```json
thirdPartyConfigs: {
  // hubspot app client ID, required
  // get it from your hubspot app, https://app.hubspot.com/developer
  clientIDHS: ,
  // hubspot app client Secret,
  clientSecretHS: ,
  // hubspot app auth server, not required
  // appServerHS: 'https://app.hubspot.com',
  // hubspot app api server, not required
  // apiServerHS: 'https://app.hubspot.com',
  // hubspot app redirect uri, not required
  // appRedirectHS: 'https://zxdong262.github.io/hubspot-embeddable-ringcentral-phone/app/redirect.html',
  // show call log sync desc form or not
  // showCallLogSyncForm: true
},
```

## Start Up
